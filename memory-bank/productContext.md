# Product Context: Oliver Pipeline Dashboard

## Purpose
The Oliver Pipeline Dashboard exists to solve the challenge of managing team resources, project allocations, and business opportunities in a visual and interactive way. It serves as a personal pipeline management tool for team leads or managers who need to track multiple team members, projects, and business development activities.

## Problems Solved

### Resource Allocation Visibility
- **Problem**: Difficulty in visualizing how team members' time is allocated across projects
- **Solution**: Color-coded capacity bars and pie charts showing allocation by category

### Utilization Tracking
- **Problem**: Challenges in identifying over-utilization or under-utilization of team members
- **Solution**: Clear percentage indicators and visual cues (red for over-capacity, green for healthy utilization)

### Revenue Forecasting
- **Problem**: Lack of clarity on confirmed vs. potential revenue streams
- **Solution**: Breakdown of revenue by status (confirmed, pending, pipeline) with visual representations

### Business Development Impact
- **Problem**: Difficulty in quantifying the time impact of business development activities
- **Solution**: Tracking of business development activities with time impact assessments

### Data Management
- **Problem**: Static dashboards that require developer intervention to update
- **Solution**: Edit mode functionality allowing users to update data directly in the interface
