## Current Status
The dashboard is functional with all core features implemented. The recent addition of the edit mode and category management system has significantly enhanced the usability of the dashboard, allowing users to update data directly within the interface.

The category system has been simplified by removing the dynamic category management button and using fixed categories. Pie chart labels have been removed for a cleaner UI, relying on tooltips and the legend for information. The edit mode provides a seamless experience for updating team allocations, projects, and other data points.

## Known Issues
- No data validation is currently in place, allowing users to enter invalid data
- Changes are not persisted between page refreshes, as there is no data storage mechanism
